# Visual-Cryptography-GUI-Tool
Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.  

where an image was broken up into N number of shares so that only someone with all N shares could decrypt the image, while any N âˆ’ 1 shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all n shares were overlaid, the original image would appear.  

The basic principle of the visual cryptography scheme (VCS) was first introduced by Naor and Shamir. VCS is a kind of secret sharing scheme that focuses on sharing secret images.

Steps:
- Interface Design in Windows Application
- Visual cryptography implementation
- Encoding
- Decoding
- Creating Transparencies
- Break images into multiple shares
- Visual Cryptography on Images
- Saving Image Shares on Hard Drive
- Uploading Module
